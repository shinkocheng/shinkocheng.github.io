I use screen a lot for work. but when i want to see the history in terminal,
typing `^a-[` and then up/down arrow gets tedious in a heartbeat. i discovered
recently that you can put the following command in the `~/.screenrc` file in the
machine where screen is run, and youâ€™ll have the capability to scroll through
the history.

{% highlight bash %}
# Make xterm scrolling work properly with screen
termcapinfo xterm-256color|xterm-color|xterm|xterms|xs|rxvt ti@:te@
{% endhighlight %}
